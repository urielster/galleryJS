# galleryJS

www.flickr.com is a known photo sharing site. flickr provides a well-documented API for exploring photos and other tasks.
Your goal in this exercise is to create an HTML/javascript application that will use this public feed:

http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne ,and show the thumbnails images as a gallery.

Each item should include the following information:

The thumbnail.
Link to the photo page.
The title of the image.
The author.
Date taken.

* Clicking on the author’s name should reload the gallery with the author’s photos only.

Notes !important:

Use the Flickr documentation.
No need for api key
Take into consideration the UI design and the usability of the page.
Using no js/css framework. 
Pay attention to your coding style and code-design/Patterns.
Responsiveness (like mobile appearance) - (Good to have)
Think of scalability/ how to make your code useful for other people (like open source code) (Bonus)
